# Droplet Evaporation Simulation

This project simulates the evaporation and dynamics of an n-Decane droplet in a heated airflow, using both the D² Law and Infinite Liquid Conductivity models. It visualizes droplet diameter, temperature, velocity, and axial position over time.

## Features

- **D² Law Model** and **Infinite Liquid Conductivity Model** simulations
- Plots for droplet diameter, temperature, and axial velocity
- Adjustable parameters and configurations for droplet properties and environmental conditions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DropletEvaporationSimulation.git
cd DropletEvaporationSimulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
